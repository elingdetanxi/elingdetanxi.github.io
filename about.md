	<p class="intro"> A new postdoc, who struggles to transit from chinese mode into u.s. one. </p>
	<p> This website was inspired by <a href = "https://samxshang.github.io/about/">Samantha Shang</a>, who shared the procedure in <a href = "https://womenoverseas.com/t/topic/17528">women overseas</a>. I try to record some important thoughts in my research.</p>
			
	<h2> Research </h2>
	<p> I'm a new postdoc in CEE, Cornell University. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Tongji University, Shanghai, and worked for SUS Environment Co. during Covid lockdown. After I got Visa from Singapore, I finally arrived in Ithaca to persue my research about N and P removal in wastewater. Thanks to my PI for not giving up on me!</p>
	<h3> research topics </h3>
		<li> Anammox </li>
  		<li> PdN </li>
	
	<h2> Personal </h2>
	<p>I love to try something new. I hope I can keep recording fot half a year, which is my small task in 2021. </p>
